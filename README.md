# IG Code Challenge
_Last updated: 28 November 19_

Welcome to the Team! Your manager has asked you to work on our latest app: FX World.
The app uses the DailyFX API to link users to the top FX news articles for the day, and to see which markets are rated as "Top Markets".

The app is still missing a few key features: 
- The article should open it's URL when tapped
- We should see another screen with a list of "Top Markets" that day

We would like you to think of a suitable user experience, please feel free to add any more features if you have time.  

Bonus points for:
- Using the MVVM+C architecture
- Testing any business logic

Please spend around 4 hours on the task, place the entire project folder in a zip file return it to us. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask us.
